Individual Status Report - Week 3

	Copy of Individual Status Report Goals: empty because this is the first individual status report.

	As stated in the first team status report, we started by setting up communication channels, this repository and our meeting times. We settled on Discord for communication and a flexible meeting each on Tuesday and Thursday. Afterwards, we worked on our project proposal and got feedback on it. In the received comments, one was specifically about the part I had written; I had used vague language and only gave a mediocre explanation about how two ideas weren't contradictory. I'll try to make a similar mistake again. After the proposal, we split up the initial research we had to do into 3 sections: data collection, data formatting and automatic verification. I chose to research automatic verification. I was sick on Monday, so the Tuesday meeting will be pretty important to get myself on track.

	Goals:
		- Do research on automated verification strategies, as per the proposal's description.
		- Discuss with my team and mentor in the Tuesday/Thursday meetings to be ready for the "Proj3: Architecture and implementation plan" due on Thursday.
			- Specifically, as we're already conceptually divided the project into 3 parts, formalize it with some sort of schedule/plan.
			- Each person should have some starting ideas on how a team of 3 could do each component.
